The 8-bit-sheep network is powered by Sami, the Bellwether. He is a humanist who dreams of 8-bit sheep. The results of these nightly builds are put into practice at 8-bit-sheep, a consultancy that helps companies with digital transformation and putting data & AI into practice. A seasoned executive with three superpowers — data & AI, visionary leadership, and media — during the past decade he has been helping legacy organisations with digital transformation. For Sami, this transformation is about understanding that everything today is software.
Sami founded his first professional online media service almost 25 years ago. For three years he worked in the CDO role at Yle, the Finnish Broadcasting Company, where he was responsible for driving the modernisation of the application architecture, and introducing AI and data platforms early to the organisation. Later, he worked in the management team of KSF Media for two years with CDO & CTO responsibilities. Sami has implemented radical transformation programmes both in terms of product development and leadership. Since 3 - 4 years ago, when it became apparent that data & AI are both a question of business hygiene and competitive advantage, the subject has very much been at the centre of Sami’s focus.

* The name

The name “8-bit-sheep” was picked from the 
founder Sami Kallinens Twitter bio since many years. He introduces himself there with the sentence “I’m a humanist that dreams of 8-bit sheep.” This partly plays on the tension between arts and humanities and technology and how Kallinen has always felt comfortable and confident in both of these sometimes exclusive universes. In fact, Kallinen believes in the necessity of uniting these worlds, especially considering the type of problems 
we are today facing. 

The phrase “dream of 8-bit-sheep” is of 
course a nod to the classic sci-fi novel by Philip K Dick “Do androids dream of electric sheep” which was adopted to the the screen by Ridley Scott in the masterpiece “Bladerunner”. Kallinen also belongs to the generation who first encountered digitalization by hacking 8-bit computers in the early 80ies.
